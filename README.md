# Plateau program (max sequence length) (a combinatorial algorithm)  
The array a(1..n) contains sorted integers. Write a function maxlen(a,n) that returns the
length of the longest sequence of identical numbers (for example, if
a=(1,1,1,2,3,3,5,6,6,6,6,7,9) then maxlen returns 4 because the longest sequence 6,6,6,6
contains 4 numbers. Write a demo main program for testing the work of maxlen. Explain
your solution, and insert comments in your program. The solution should have time
complexity O(n).

# Implementation

My method for returning the length of the longest sequence of identical numbers involves using a for loop that iterates over an array of numers, counts the frequency of each number, and stores the largest frequency in a variable which is returned by maxlen().

What seperates my method from others, is that it takes into account for the average frequency of numbers and attempts to skip over large portions when able. The average frequency of numbers is calculated by dividing the total number of elements in the array already examined, by how many unique numbers have been presented. When the next unique number is indexed, this snippit of code will attempt to see if it is at the current index plus the average frequency:

        temp == array[i + avgLength]

If the new number is located there, then the array will skip to that point and continue it&#39;s evaluation. If the new number is not located there, then it will try again but at half of the average frequency:

        temp == array[i + avgLength/2]

If this returns true, it will behave like mentioned above. If false, then the code will proceed through this number index by index until the next unique number is reached.

I decided to use this method so that my average time complexity case would not always be equal to my worst time complexity case. This algorithm works best with number frequencies that are of roughly similar length. This code does not receive a boost of efficiency with low frequency numbers.

# Plateau program (max sequence length) (a combinatorial algorithm)  
The array a(1..n) contains sorted integers. Write a function maxlen(a,n) that returns the
length of the longest sequence of identical numbers (for example, if
a=(1,1,1,2,3,3,5,6,6,6,6,7,9) then maxlen returns 4 because the longest sequence 6,6,6,6
contains 4 numbers. Write a demo main program for testing the work of maxlen. Explain
your solution, and insert comments in your program. The solution should have time
complexity O(n).
